# 🤖 ML Prediction Models

A curated collection of machine learning models developed by [Shah Fahad Hashmi](https://github.com/shahfahadhashmi) for real-world predictive analytics. This repository currently includes:

- 📰 Fake News Detection Model
- 💉 Diabetes Prediction Model

These models are built using structured datasets and implement key machine learning techniques including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-learn.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to two critical domains:

1. Fake News Detection**  
   Detects whether a news article is real or fake using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

2. Diabetes Prediction  
   Predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health metrics using supervised classification algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression.

Each model is self-contained and can be trained, evaluated, and tuned with minimal setup.
